[Jakarta EE 8](https://jakarta.ee/) was released  at the first [Jakarta EE One](https://jakartaone.org/) online conference which was driven by Eclipse Foundation. 

Jakarta EE 8 is the first version released by Eclipse Foundation.  Compared to the previous Java EE 8, the new Jakarta EE 8 neither introduced new specifications nor updated the existing ones , the main work was moving all specifications and related projects to  Eclipse foundation, and cleaning up the issue of their licenses.
